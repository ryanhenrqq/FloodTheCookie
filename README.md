# 🍪 FloodTheCookie

- **Flood the Cookie** It's a click-to-earn game with a strong focus on the script.

- In short, this is a recreation of a famous game where you click on a cookie to earn points, but using website-directed language, designed to be a great passtime and a basic understanding of logic and game design.

- ⚠️ **Flood the Cookie is a simplified version of Cookie Clicker, available on Steam, with no intention of making a profit.**

## 🎯 Functionalities and Goal

- The user starts on the selection screen (index.html), to decide whether to start a new game or continue the previous one.

- When starting a new game, it takes you to the game's main menu (which is also the same menu for pausing), with 3 main buttons: Start, Restart, and Leave.

- When starting a new game, the user's browser switches to full screen intent, and a black header appears with the following items: Menu/Pause, Game Name, and Current Score. In the center of the screen (with a dark blue background) there is a cookie constantly spinning clockwise, and below it is a white menu with two buttons: ClickBooster (x points) & ProductionLine (y points). ->

- The ClickPower is a kind of powerup: by default, a user's click can only earn 1 point per click. By purchasing the multiplier, the user's click will be worth twice as much. For example: 1 click starts to be equivalent to 2 clicks, earning 2 points per second.

- ProductionLine is a click without user interaction: by default, the player starts without any ProductionLine, requiring a certain number of points (y) to unlock it. After unlocking this function, the user can upgrade it similarly to a ClickPower. For example: 1 cp/s equals 1 click per second, and by purchasing ProductionLine, the clicks per second will multiply, becoming 2 clicks per second (2 cp/s).

- For reference, the current value of the Multiplier and Automated settings is indicated below the purchase menu.
